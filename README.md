The following implementation works as follows :

g++ sequentialLTPD.cpp
./a.out <sample_input

The sample input file is of the following format:

The transition probability matrix (of size m*m)

The initial probability array (of size m)

The emission matrix (of size m*n)

The current observation seqence(of size t)

Output:

The viterbi matrix

The hidden observation sequence
